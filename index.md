Hi, I'm Danica. I've made a lot of VR projects in Unity, and I'm currently doing research for ARTEMIS, a VR surgical simulation tool. I've also made quite a few games, and I love art, videogames, and Anime. Currently reading Tokyo Revengers.

**Quote of the week:**

    System.out.println("leetcode it out");
}
```
